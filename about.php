				<h1>Community</h1>
				<p>Hi!</p>

				<p>SteamLUG (<em>Steam Linux Users Group</em>) is a community of users (<em>old and new</em>) and fans of <a href = 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux'>GNU/Linux</a> - GNU based Free Software operating systems which use the Linux kernel, which we sometimes refer to as just "<em>Linux</em>".</p>

				<p>We are a multilingual community which aims to be a fun, welcoming space for people of all backgrounds and aptitudes.</p>
				
				<p>We also cover <a href = 'news'>Steam for Linux news</a> (<em>Valve news, Steam news, and native Linux games</em>), as well as host <a href = 'servers'>game servers</a> and regular <a href = 'events'>gaming events</a>.

				<p>The SteamLUG community operates the <a href = 'chat'>#SteamLUG IRC channel</a> (<em>click for details and webchat</em>), runs a Mumble <a href = 'mumble'>voice chat server</a> (<em>using the same password that we use for our game servers - you can see this on the Steam group event pages if you are a member of our Steam group</em>), and a <a href = 'http://steamcommunity.com/groups/steamlug/'>Steam group</a> with over 5,000 members.</p>
				
				<p>Our rich and diverse community consists of people ranging from first-time Linux users through to developers, long-time gamers through to industry commentators. You may even see a Valve person hanging around from time to time (<em>if you do spot one, we ask that you respect their desire to be a normal part of our community and not bombard them with questions, complaints or bug reports - there are <a href = 'https://github.com/ValveSoftware/steam-for-linux/'>other channels</a> for that</em>).</p>
				<p>We always aim to be as welcoming of newcomers as possible, so please feel free to join us! :)</p>

				<h1>History</h1>
				<p>The SteamLUG community is an amalgamation of several communities which previously existed independently.</p>
				<h2>Steam Group</h2>
<p>Originally created by Skybon as "We Want Linux Client!". Gained popularity and quickly achieved the critical mass needed to sustain its position as the biggest Steam group of Linux users on Steam in spite of its dormancy. In 2012, Russian admin Zenitur handed ownership of the group over to Cheeseness, who brought the group back into an active state and merged it with the existing SteamLUG IRC community to coincide with the release of Steam for Linux.</p>
				<h2>SPUF Thread</h2>
<p>Prior to the introduction of Steam for Linux, discussion of Linux on the Steam Powered User Forums was confined to a single thread, bringing together people of varying backgrounds and creating engaging discussion. In 2011, meklu registered the #SteamLUG IRC channel on Freenode.net following a suggestion by DerRidda in the ____th iteration of the Linux Thread (started by Madrang). Towards the end of 2012, as Steam for Linux became available, activity in the Linux Thread died down.</p>
				<h2>IRC Channel</h2>
<p>Registered in 2011 by meklu, the #SteamLUG IRC channel became a place for the active members of the SteamLUG community to gather and plan their respective projects (steamlinux, humvis, etc. - probably don't need specific mention?), and continued to grow the community as activity in the Linux Thread died down. When the Steam for Linux beta was released, the average number of users more than doubled, bringing in a swath of Linux gaming enthusiasts.</p>
				<h2>SteamLUG.org</h2>
<p>In March 2013, through the efforts of swordfischer, meklu and Cheeseness, SteamLUG.org was launched to provide a central hub for SteamLUG's many faceted community, providing webchat access to IRC, a portal for SteamLUG projects, a live list of upcoming and past SteamLUG events, details of SteamLUG's game and Mumble servers.</p>

				<h1>Steam for Linux</h1>
<p>After long standing rumour and speculation, official news of Steam for Linux finally made an appearance in a 7DCD interview with Valve CEO Gabe Newall who mentioned he had been personally working with Valve's Linux team.</p>
<p>Valve later launched a Linux themed blog to cover their progress in developing Steam for Linux and porting their games.</p>
<p>An official Steam group for the Steam for Linux beta was created and quickly reached membership in the tens of thousands.</p>
<p>A survey was launched to gather details of people interested in participating in the Steam for Linux beta (with a recommendation that inexperienced Linux users be patient and wait for a later release). Over 60,000 people responded within the first week.</p>
<p>Steam for Linux beta was launched in December 2012 with ___ games.</p>
<p>Valve launched a GitHub repository to track bug/issue reports after the official Steam Community group became unmanageable.</p>
<p>Steam for Linux was fully released in February 2013 with over 60 titles (more than the Steam for Mac launch), accompanied by a Linux title sale and a promotional item for anybody who played Team Fortress 2 during the following two weeks.</p>
<p>Valve continue to release additional titles, and the catalogue of non-Valve games continues to grow.</p>
